# React JSX Exercises
## Overview
In each subfolder you will find an `index.html` and an `app.js`  file. There is some starting information in each app.js file. Open the index.html file in your browser and take a look at how it renders to start. Then complete the task.

## Exercises
### First Component
Make the `<FirstComponent>` component render like the [Windows Logo](https://goo.gl/images/mY5Qdv)

### List Group
Make the `<ListGroup>`  component render a bunch of `<ListGroupItem>`  components.

### Blog
Make the `<Blog>` component render a `<Header>`, `<Article>` and a `<Footer>` component. There is more detail about each component in the `app.js`  file.

### Comments
Make the `<Comments>` component render a bunch of `<Comment>` components,  and make the `<Comment>` component render a `<ProfilePic>` and a `<CommentBody>` component.

### Form
Make the `<Form>` render a form tag with 3 text inputs, two yes/no radio buttons, and a submit button.  Make sure you use the `<TextInput>`, `<YesNoRadio>` and `<SubmitButton>` components instead of plain html tags.

## Bonus
Use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) or [any other CSS framework](https://www.google.com/search?q=trendy+css+framework) and style up each of your components. You'll have to include the framework css tag from a CDN, and include your own css tag in the `<head>` of each index file. Make sure that when you add classes to your JSX you use the `className` attribute.

## Bonus 2
Combine all the components you've built into a new single page blog with comments, and a new comment form.
